`products` is a list of objects, each object has an `id` field.

```yaml
products:
  - id: apm
```

Each product ID is mapped to a full product name.
You use the product ID in the source files, and docs-builder will use the full product name in
a `product_name` `meta` tag in the generated HTML and YAML metadata in generated Markdown files,
which are used to drive elastic.co search functionality.
