# `versions.yml`

The [`versions.yml`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/blob/main/config/versions.yml) file specifies which versions of each product should be recognized as the minimum (base) and the latest (current) in documentation builds. These versions are surfaced to the user via `applies_to` tags.
