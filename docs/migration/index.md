# Migration to docs-builder

:::{important}
All repositories have been migrated to `docs-builder` however older branches may still be using `asciidoc`.
:::

Migrating to Elastic Docs V3 is more than just moving to a new documentation build system. This migration includes:

* [New syntax](./syntax.md): from AsciiDoc to Markdown
* [New information architecture (IA)](./ia.md): aligning docs around user goals, not internal org structure
* [New versioning](./versioning.md): consolidation from many to one
* [New reference guidelines](./engineering.md): Engineering ownership of reference documentation & New API guidelines
