# File structure

In both the AsciiDoc- and V3-based systems, file structure is largely independent from the resulting site navigation.

## File and directory structure

AsciiDoc files and assets (like images and videos) can be stored anywhere within the directories provided as `sources` for a given book in the central [`config.yaml` file in the /docs repo](https://github.com/elastic/docs/blob/master/conf.yaml).
