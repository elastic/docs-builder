# Best practices for using `applies_to`

Depending on what you're trying to communicate, you can use the following patterns to represent version and deployment type differences in your docs.

## General guidelines

% Reference: Slack conversation
* The `applies_to` badges should not require contributors to add specific Markdown real estate
  to the page layout (such as a specific `Version` column in a table).
  Instead, contributors should be able to add them anywhere they need, and the system should
  be in charge of rendering them clearly.

% Reference: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/229485/files#r2231876006
* Avoid using version numbers in prose adjacent to `applies_to` badge to prevent
  confusion when the badge is rended with `Planned` ahead of a release.

% Reference: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/229485/files#r2231850710
* Create hierarchy of versioned information??

% Reference: https://elastic.github.io/docs-builder/versions/#defaults-and-hierarchy
* Do not assume a default deployment type, stack flavor, product version, or project type.
  Treat all flavors and deployment types equally. Don't treat one as the "base" and the other as the "exception".

## Order of items

**Versions.** Always put the newest version first when listing multiple versions. As a result, the lifecycles should be in order of product development progression, too.

% Reference: https://elastic.github.io/docs-builder/versions/#defaults-and-hierarchy
% Needs work...
**Keys.** Always list [keys](/contribute/cumulative-docs/reference.md#key) in the same order for consistency. The order of keys should reflect organizational priorities. For example, use the following order:
* **Serverless/Elastic Stack**: Serverless, Stack
* **Deployment types**: Elastic Cloud Serverless, Elastic Cloud Hosted, Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes, Elastic Cloud Enterprise, Self-managed
* **Monitoring for Java applications**: Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (EDOT) Java, APM Java agent

## Placement of badges

% Reference: https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/issues/1574
### Headings

Use [section annotations](/syntax/applies.md#section-annotations) immediately after a heading when the entire content between that heading and the next [heading](/syntax/headings.md) of the same and higher level.

For example, in the [Semantic text field type](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text#custom-by-pipelines) page, all the content in this section is only applicable to Elastic Stack versions 9.0.0 and later.

:::{warning}
Do **not** use [inline annotations](/syntax/applies.md#inline-annotations) with headings, which will cause rendering issues in _On this page_.

### Definition lists

The recommended placement of `applies_to` badges in definition lists varies based what part(s) of the list item relate to the badge.

**If the badge is relevant to the entire contents of a list item, put it at the end of the term.** This means using an inline annotation at the end of the same line as the term. For example, on the Kibana [Advanced settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/kibana/advanced-settings#kibana-banners-settings) page, the entire `banners:linkColor` option is only available in Elastic Stack 9.1.0 and later.

:::{warning}
Do **not** put the `applies_to` badge at the beginning or end of the definition if it relates to the entire contents of the item.

::::{image} ./images/definition-list-item-incorrect.png
:screenshot:
:alt: Incorrectly using inline applies_to with a definition list item
::::
:::

**If the badge is only relevant to a portion of the definition, follow the appropriate placement guidelines for the elements used in the definition.** This might include labeling just one of multiple paragraphs or one item in an ordered or unordered list. For example, on the ... page, ...

::::{image} ./images/definition-list-portion-correct.png
:screenshot:
:alt: Correctly using inline applies_to in a portion of a definition list item
::::

% Reference: TBD
### Ordered and unordered lists

Reorganize content as needed so the `applies_to` badge is relevant to the entire contents of the list item.
The recommended placement of the badge varies based on the purpose of the list.

**If the purpose of the list is to illustrate the difference between situations, put a badge at the start of each item.**
This could mean distinguishing between deployment types, products, lifecycles, or versions.
For example, the [Alerting and action settings in Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/kibana/configuration-reference/alerting-settings) page lists how the default value for the `xpack.actions.preconfigured.<connector-id>.config.defaultModel` setting varies in Serverless/Stack and across versions.

::::{image} ./images/list-correct.png
:screenshot:
:alt:
::::

**If the list just happens to have one or more items that are only relevant to a specific situation, put the badge at the end of the list item.**
(deployment type, product, lifecycle, version, etc.)

### Tables

The recommended placement in tables varies based on what part(s) of the table related to the `applies_to` label.

**If the badge is relevant to the entire row, add the badge to the end of the first column.**
For example, a table that contains one setting per row and a new setting is added in 9.1.0.

<image>

**If the badge is relevant to one cell or part of a cell, add the badge to the end of the line it applies to.**
For example, a new property is available in 9.1.0 for a setting that already existed before 9.1.0.

<image>

% Reference: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/229485/files#r2231856744
:::{tip}
If needed, break the contents of the cell into multiple lines using `<br>` to isolate the content you're labeling.

<!-- ## Scenarios [scenarios]

There are several scenarios you will likely run into at some point when contributing to the docs.

### Feature in beta or technical preview is removed [beta-preview-removed]

If a feature in beta or technical preview is removed without going GA,
[list both || remove the beta/preview version]
in the `applies_to` badge.

% TO DO: Copy over example content https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/229485/files#r2231843057
**Example: A beta option was removed one minor after it was introduced**

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Syntax

::::

### Code block change between versions [code-blocks]

If the content of a code block changes between versions,
you have a couple options depending on the nature of the change.

#### Content is added or removed [code-blocks-added-removed]

Use code callouts to point out lines that have changed over time.

**Example: One new option is available**

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Visual
:::
:::{tab-item} Syntax
:::
::::

#### Content is replaced [code-blocks-replaced]

Use a tab for each version that contains a change.

**Example**

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Visual
:::
:::{tab-item} Syntax
:::
::::

### Adjacent block elements change between versions [adjacent-block-elements]

**Example**

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Visual
:::
:::{tab-item} Syntax
:::
::::

### Images change between versions [images]

#### Screenshots

Follow these principles to use screenshots in our unversioned documentation system:

* Reduce screenshots when they donâ€™t explicitly add value.
* When adding a screenshot, determine the minimum viable screenshot and whether it can apply to all relevant versions.
* Take and maintain screenshots for only the most recent version, with very few exceptions that should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
* In case of doubt, prioritize serverless.

**Example**

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Visual
:::
:::{tab-item} Syntax
:::
::::

### UI changes between versions [ui]

**Example**

::::{tab-set}

### One sentence in a paragraph changes between versions [inline-elements]

**Example**

::::{tab-set}

### Table columns, rows, or cells change between versions
