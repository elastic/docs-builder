# How-to guides

Looking for contribution guides on how to write the docs? Refer to [Contribute to docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/contribute-docs/) on the main Elastic documentation site.

Use these guides for tasks like managing documentation files and folders, configuring repositories, and handling releases.

## Manage files and links

- [Move files and folders](move.md): Move files or folders and automatically update all links in the documentation.
- [Manage redirects across doc sets](redirects.md): Set up redirects when moving or deleting pages to prevent broken links.
- [Add changelog entries](changelog.md): Create changelog files using the command-line interface.

## Repository management

- [Add a new repository to the docs](add-repo.md): Add a new docs repository to the assembly process.
- [Choose a branching strategy](branching-strategy.md): Choose the right docs branching strategy for your repository.

## Release management

- [Release a new documentation version](release-new-version.md): Update the docs site when a new version of the Elastic Stack or other versioned product is released.
