The way that you contribute to the docs depends on the product version.

For a list of versions covered on [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs), refer to [Find docs for your product version](/get-started/versioning-availability.md#find-docs-for-your-product-version). Versions prior to the versions listed on that page are documented on our legacy system, [elastic.co/guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide). 

:::{tip}
Unversioned products, such as {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, are documented on [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs).
