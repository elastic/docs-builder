# Contribute on the web

This section will help you understand how to update and contribute to our documentation post-migration.

## Updating documentation

:::{include} _snippets/two-systems.md

### Update elastic.co/docs (Docs V3) [docs]

:::{include} _snippets/docs-intro.md
:::

For content hosted on elastic.co/docs, most conceptual and narrative content is stored in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository, and most reference content is hosted in the relevant product's repository. Follow these steps to ensure your contributions are correctly made:

1. Navigate to the page that is impacted.  
2. Click the **Edit** button.  
3. Identify the section that requires updates.  
4. Make the necessary updates.  
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request.

### Update elastic.co/guide [guide]

:::{include} _snippets/guide-intro.md
:::

These changes should be made in the original source folders in their respective repositories. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the page that is impacted.  
2. Click the **Edit** button.  
3. Ensure the targeted branch is \<insert proper branch\>.  
4. Make the necessary updates.  
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request.  
6. Add the appropriate labels as required by the repo. To learn which labels to add, refer to the contribution documentation for that repo or reach out to the file codeowners.

:::{note}
If you are working in a repo like Kibana or the cloud repo, backports can be complicated. You can use the [backport tool](https://github.com/sorenlouv/backport) to manage your backport.

## What if I need to update docs in both systems?

If you need to merge changes that are published in both systems (usually because a change is valid in multiple product versions, such as stack 9.x and 8.x) it is recommended to update the documentation in elastic.co/docs first. Then you can convert the updates to ASCIIDoc and make the changes to the elastic.co/guide documentation. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Install [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to convert your markdown file to asciidoc  
2. Update the /docs content first in markdown as described in [Update elastic.co/docs](#docs) in the relevant repository.  
3. Run your changes through pandoc:  
   1. If you need to bring over the entire file, you can run the following command and it will create an asciidoc file for you. `pandoc -f gfm -t asciidoc ./<file-name>.md -o <file-name>.asciidoc`  
   2. If you just need to port a specific section you can use: `pandoc -f gfm -t asciidoc ./<file-name>.md` and the output of the file will be in your command window from which you can copy.  
4. Follow the steps in [Update elastic.co/guide](#guide) to publish your changes.   
5. If the change is too large or complicated, create a new issue in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) or [`docs-content-internal`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content-internal) repository detailing the changes made for the team to triage.  
6. Merge the changes and close the issue once the updates are reflected in the documentation.

## Migration considerations

During the migration, content may be moved around, and there won't be a 1-to-1 mapping between old and new locations. This means updates may need to be applied in multiple places. If your changes affect /guide content, consider merging those changes in the /docs content first and then add it to the appropriate /guide content. If you have any issues, create an issue in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) or [`docs-content-internal`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content-internal) repository.
