## Prerequisites

To write and push updates to Elastic documentation, you need the following:

1. **A code editor**: we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. **Git installed on your machine**: learn how [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
1. **A GitHub account**: sign up [here](https://github.com/)

## Step 1: Install `docs-builder` [#step-one]

There are two different ways to install and run `docs-builder`:

1. Download, extract, and run the binary (recommended).
1. Clone the repository and build the binary from source.

This guide uses the first option. If you'd like to clone the repository and build from source, learn how in the [project readme](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder?tab=readme-ov-file#docs-builder).

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} macOS & Linux

1. **Download and run the install script**   

   Run this command to download and install the latest version of `docs-builder`:

   ```sh
   sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/docs-builder/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
   
   This downloads the latest binary, makes it executable, and installs it to your user PATH.

2. **Run docs-builder from a docs folder**

   Use the `serve` command from any docs folder to start serving the documentation at http://localhost:3000. The path to the `docset.yml` file that you want to build can be specified with `-p`:

   ```sh
   docs-builder serve
   ```

To download and install the binary file manually, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/releases) on GitHub. 

If you get a `Permission denied` error, make sure that you aren't trying to run a directory instead of a file. Also, grant the binary file execution permissions using `chmod +x docs-builder`.

:::{tab-item} Windows

1. **Download and run the install script**   

   Run this command to download and install the latest version of `docs-builder`:

   ```powershell
   iex (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/docs-builder/refs/heads/main/install.ps1')
   ```

   This downloads the latest binary, makes it executable, and installs it to your user PATH.

2. **Run docs-builder from a docs folder**

   Use the `serve` command from any docs folder to start serving the documentation at http://localhost:3000. The path to the `docset.yml` file that you want to build can be specified with `-p`:

   ```sh
   docs-builder serve
   ```

To download and install the binary file manually, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder/releases) on GitHub.

## Clone a content repository [#step-two]

:::{tip}
Documentation lives in many repositories across Elastic. If you're unsure which repository to clone, you can use the "Edit this page" link on any documentation page to determine where the source file lives.
:::

In this guide, we'll clone the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository. The `docs-content` repository is the home for narrative documentation at Elastic. Clone this repo to a directory of your choice:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/elastic/docs-content.git
```

## Serve the Documentation [#step-three]

1. **Navigate to the `docs-builder` clone location:**
   ```sh
   cd docs-content
   ```

1. **Run the Binary:**
   Run the binary with the `serve` command to build and serve the content set to http://localhost:3000. Specify the path to the `docset.yml` file that you want to build with `-p`.

   For example, if `docs-builder` and `docs-content` are in the same top-level directory, you would run:
   ```sh
   # macOS/Linux
   ./docs-builder serve -p ./migration-test

   # Windows
   .\docs-builder serve -p .\migration-test
   ```

Now you should be able to view the documentation locally by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Step 4: Write docs [#step-four]

We write docs in markdown. See our [syntax](../syntax/index.md) guide for the flavor of markdown that we support and all of our custom directives that enable you to add a little extra pizazz to your docs.

## Step 5: Push your changes [#step-five]

After you've made your changes locally,

* [Push your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
* [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Step 5: View on elastic.co/docs
