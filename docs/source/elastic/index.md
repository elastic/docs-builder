title: Elastic content

The goal of this section is to demo real Elastic documentation in Elastic Docs v3. Please feel free to add your own examples.

Here's what we have so far:

* [Automated Settings Reference](reference/index.md) — An example of an automatically automated setting
* [Observability overview](observability/index.md) — Nothing special, just a bunch of images and text.
