We are ready to migrate our documentation to our new build system, [elastic/docs-builder](https://github.com/elastic/docs-builder)!

:::{important}
We will enforce a [Documentation Freeze](./freeze/index.md) while we migration docs between our two build systems.

Migrating to Elastic Docs V3 is more than just moving to a new documentation build system. This migration also includes:

* [Transition from AsciiDoc to Markdown](./syntax.md)
* [Improved information architecture](./ia.md)
* [Consolidated versioning](./versioning.md)
* [Engineering ownership of reference documentation & New API guidelines](./engineering.md)
