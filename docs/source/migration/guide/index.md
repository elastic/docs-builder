How to migrate content from Asciidoc to V3.

## Migration tooling

Use the [adoc-to-md](https://github.com/elastic/adoc-to-md) conversion tool to migrate content sets from Asciidoc syntax to docs-builder syntax. Instructions to use the tool are in the readme file.

After running the migration tool, you can move and manipulate files while viewing a live preview of the content with docs-builder.

## Building migrated content sets for the bug bash

Assuming the following directory structure:

```markdown
{GitHub_Repo_Dir}/
├── tools/
│   ├── docs-builder-mac-arm64.zip
│   └── docs-builder
├── elasticsearch.md
├── observability-docs.md
└── kibana.md
```

You can build migrated content sets on a Mac by running the following commands.

```{tip}

```bash
# move to GitHub dir
