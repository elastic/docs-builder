How to migrate content from Asciidoc to V3.

## Migration tooling

Use the [adoc-to-md](https://github.com/elastic/adoc-to-md) conversion tool to migrate content sets from Asciidoc syntax to docs-builder syntax. Instructions to use the tool are in the readme file.

After running the migration tool, you can move, and manipulate files while viewing a live preview of the content with docs-builder.
