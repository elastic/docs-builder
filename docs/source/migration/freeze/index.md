# Documentation Freeze

During the documentation freeze, the Docs team will focus almost entirely on migration tasks to ensure all content is successfully migrated and will handle only emergency documentation requests and release-related activities. When the migration is complete, the docs team will assess any documentation requests that were submitted during the documentation freeze and ensure that they're still relevant in the new information architecture and format.

To make the transition to Elastic Docs v3 as smooth as possible, weâ€™ve established a process to track and manage documentation requests during the migration:

* Open an issue in [elastic/docs-content](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content/issues), including details about the documentation requirements, links to resources, and drafts of documentation in GDocs.
* Post in [#docs](https://elastic.slack.com/archives/C0JF80CJZ) for emergency documentation requests.

During the documentation freeze, maintaining consistency and avoiding conflicts is key. To prevent documentation changes from merging during the documentation freeze, a [GH Action](./gh-action.md) is being added to /docs directories for public-facing documentation in all relevant repositories.
