# Inbound Links

Outbound links, those going from the documentation set to other sources, are validated as part of the build process.

Inbound links, those going from other sources to the documentation set, are validated using specialized commands.

- [inbound-links validate](links/inbound-links-validate.md)  - validate inbound links from and to specific repositories
- [inbound-links validate-link-reference](links/inbound-links-validate-link-reference.md) - validate a local link reference artifact from [build](docset/build.md) with the published registry
