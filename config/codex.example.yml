# Codex Configuration Example
# This file demonstrates how to configure a documentation codex that
# composes multiple isolated documentation sets.
#
# Usage:
#   docs-builder codex config/codex.example.yml
#   docs-builder codex clone config/codex.example.yml
#   docs-builder codex build config/codex.example.yml
#   docs-builder codex serve

# Site prefix for all codex URLs
# All documentation sets will be served under this prefix
# e.g., /internal-docs, /dev-docs, /docs
# Set to "/" or omit for no prefix (site hosted at root, e.g., codex.elastic.dev)
site_prefix: /

# Title displayed on the codex index page
title: "Elastic's Internal Dev Docs"

# Documentation sets to include in the codex
# Each documentation set is cloned from a git repository and built separately
documentation_sets:
  # APM Managed Intake Service documentation
  - name: docs-eng-team
    category: docs
    display_name: "Docs Engineering"
    icon: wordWrap

  # CI Developer Guide
  - name: docs-content-internal
    category: docs
    display_name: "Docs Content Internal"
    icon: ci

# Configuration options reference:
#
# name (required):
#   The identifier for the documentation set. Used as the default for
#   origin (elastic/{name}) and repo_name.
#
# origin (optional):
#   The git repository to clone from. Defaults to "elastic/{name}".
#   Can be a short form like "elastic/my-repo" or a full URL.
#
# branch (required):
#   The git branch to checkout.
#
# path (optional):
#   The directory within the repository containing documentation.
#   Defaults to "docs".
#
# category (optional):
#   Group documentation sets under a category (group).
#   Repos use stable URLs: /r/{repo_name}/ (or /{site_prefix}/r/{repo_name}/ with prefix)
#   Group landing: /g/{category}/ (or /{site_prefix}/g/{category}/ with prefix)
#   Group membership only affects which sidebar navigation is shown, not the URL.
#
# repo_name (optional):
#   Override the name used for checkout directories and URL paths.
#   Defaults to the value of "name". This allows including the same
#   repository multiple times with different URL paths.
#
# display_name (optional):
#   The title shown on the codex landing page card.
#   If not specified, uses the documentation set's title from docset.yml.
#
# icon (optional):
#   Icon shown on the codex landing page card.
#   Available icons: elasticsearch, kibana, observability, security,
#   enterprise-search, logstash, beats, apm, fleet, cloud, integrations,
#   docs, dev-tools, benchmark, migration, testing, ci, architecture,
#   consulting, artifactory
