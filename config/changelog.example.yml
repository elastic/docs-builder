# Changelog Configuration
# This file configures the valid values for changelog fields using the pivot structure.
# Place this file as `changelog.yml` in the `docs/` directory
#
# NOTE: All list-like fields accept BOTH forms:
#   - Comma-separated string: "value1, value2, value3"
#   - YAML list:
#     - value1
#     - value2
#     - value3
# Both forms produce the same result. Choose whichever is more readable for your use case.

# Products configuration (optional)
# If not specified, all products from products.yml are allowed
products:
  # List of available product IDs (empty = all from products.yml)
  # Accepts string or list: "elasticsearch, kibana" or [elasticsearch, kibana]
  available: []
  # Default products when --products not specified
  # default:
  #   - product: elasticsearch
  #     lifecycle: ga

# Extraction configuration
# Controls automatic extraction of information from PR descriptions
extract:
  # Auto-extract release notes from PR descriptions (default: true)
  # Can be overridden by CLI --no-extract-release-notes
  release_notes: true
  # Auto-extract issues from PR body (default: true)
  # Looks for patterns like "Fixes #123", "Closes #456", etc.
  issues: true

# Available lifecycle values (strongly typed: preview, beta, ga)
# Accepts string or list: "preview, beta, ga" or a YAML list
lifecycles:
  - preview
  - beta
  - ga

# Pivot configuration for types, subtypes, and areas with label mappings.
# By default we render entries grouped by type > subtype > area.
# NOTE: subtype and area are optional and either may be omitted.
# Labels are specified in a "label -> value" format
pivot:
  # Type definitions with optional labels
  # At a minimum, feature, bug-fix, and breaking-change must be configured.
  # Keys are type names, values can be:
  #   - simple string: comma-separated label list (e.g., ">bug, >fix")
  #   - YAML list: [">bug", ">fix"]
  #   - empty/null: no labels for this type
  #   - object: { labels: "...", subtypes: {...} } for breaking-change type only
  #     (labels and subtype values also accept string or list)
  types:
    # Complex object form with subtypes (ONLY allowed for breaking-change)
    # Subtypes help categorize breaking changes by their nature
    # Both labels and subtype values accept string or list form
    breaking-change:
      labels: ">breaking, >bc"
      # Equivalent list form:
      # labels:
      #   - ">breaking"
      #   - ">bc"
      subtypes:
        api: ">api-breaking"
        behavioral: ">behavioral-breaking"
        configuration: ">config-breaking"
        dependency: ">dependency-breaking"
        subscription: ">subscription-breaking"
        plugin: ">plugin-breaking"
        security: ">security-breaking"
        other:
    # Simple string form: labels as comma-separated string
    bug-fix: ">bug"
    deprecation: ">deprecation"
    # Empty block: no labels (YAML null)
    feature:
    enhancement:

    security:

  # Labels that trigger the highlight flag (accepts string or list)
  # String form: highlight: ">highlight, >release-highlight"
  # List form:
  # highlight:
  #   - ">highlight"
  #   - ">release-highlight"

  # Area definitions with labels
  # Keys are area display names, values are label strings or lists
  # String form: "label1, label2" | List form: [label1, label2]
  areas:
    # Example mappings - customize based on your label naming conventions
    # Autoscaling: ":Distributed Coordination/Autoscaling"
    # Search: ":Search/Search"
    # Security: ":Security/Security"
    # Watcher: ":Data Management/Watcher"
    # List form example:
    # Search:
    #   - ":Search/Search"
    #   - ":Search/Ranking"

# Block configuration - combined create and publish blockers
# All list-like fields (create, types, areas) accept string or list form
block:
  # Global labels that block changelog creation for all products
  # String form:
  # create: ">non-issue, >test"
  # List form:
  # create:
  #   - ">non-issue"
  #   - ">test"

  # Block changelog entries from publishing based on entry type or area
  # Both types and areas accept string or list form
  # publish:
  #   types: "deprecation, known-issue"
  #   areas: "Internal"
  # Or equivalently:
  # publish:
  #   types:
  #     - deprecation
  #     - known-issue
  #   areas:
  #     - "Internal"

  # Product-specific overrides (override global blockers, don't merge)
  # Dictionary key can be a single product ID or comma-separated product IDs
  # The create and publish fields accept string or list form
  product:
    # Example: Block these labels for elasticsearch and kibana
    # 'elasticsearch, kibana':
    #   create: ">test"
    #   publish:
    #     types:
    #       - docs
    # Example: Block ILM label for cloud-serverless
    # 'cloud-serverless':
    #   create: "ILM"
    #   publish:
    #     areas:
    #       - "ILM"

# Bundle configuration (profiles and defaults)
bundle:
  # Input directory containing changelog YAML files
  directory: docs/changelog
  # Output directory for bundled changelog files
  output_directory: docs/releases
  # Whether to resolve (copy contents) by default
  resolve: true

  # Named bundle profiles for different release scenarios
  profiles:
    # Example: Elasticsearch release profile
    # elasticsearch-release:
    #   products: "elasticsearch {version} {lifecycle}"
    #   output: "elasticsearch-{version}.yaml"

    # Example: Serverless release profile
    # serverless-release:
    #   products: "cloud-serverless {version} *"
    #   output: "serverless-{version}.yaml"
    #   # Feature IDs to hide when bundling with this profile (accepts string or list)
    #   hide_features:
    #     - feature-flag-1
    #     - feature-flag-2
