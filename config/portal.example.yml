# Portal Configuration Example
# This file demonstrates how to configure a documentation portal that
# composes multiple isolated documentation sets.
#
# Usage:
#   docs-builder portal config/portal.example.yml
#   docs-builder portal clone config/portal.example.yml
#   docs-builder portal build config/portal.example.yml
#   docs-builder portal serve

# Site prefix for all portal URLs
# All documentation sets will be served under this prefix
# e.g., /internal-docs, /dev-docs, /docs
site_prefix: /internal-docs

# Title displayed on the portal index page
title: "Elastic's Internal Dev Docs"

# Documentation sets to include in the portal
# Each documentation set is cloned from a git repository and built separately
documentation_sets:
